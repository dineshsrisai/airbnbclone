# WanderLust - Vacation Rental Platform (Airbnb Clone)

WanderLust is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of a vacation rental platform. It allows users to browse listings, create new accommodations, leave reviews, and view locations on a map.

## üíª Key Technologies Used

This project is built using the MERN stack ecosystem, with a focus on modern Node.js development practices:

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM)
* **Frontend/Templating:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for dynamic views, Bootstrap 5 for styling.
* **Authentication:** Passport.js (Local Strategy) for user login/signup.
* **Validation:** Joi schema validation for server-side data integrity.
* **Mapping:** Mapbox Geocoding and Maps SDK for location display.
* **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary for managing and storing listing images.

## ‚ú® Core Application Features

### 1. Listings Module

The primary entity of the application. Each listing includes details like title, description, image, price, location, and geographical data.

### 2. Reviews & Rating

Users can view and submit reviews and ratings (1-5 stars) for any listing. Reviews are tied to the listing and the reviewer.

### 3. User Authentication & Authorization

* **Sign-Up / Log-In:** Secure user registration and login functionality.
* **Authorization:** Strict controls ensuring users can only **edit** or **delete** listings that they own.

### 4. Geolocation & Maps

Each listing displays a map showing its exact location. The geographical coordinates are automatically retrieved and saved using the **Mapbox Geocoding service** when a new listing is created.
